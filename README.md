# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


3x3 Matrix Color Change
This React application features a 3x3 matrix where each box can be clicked to change its color. Initially, clicking any box changes its color to green. When the last box is clicked, the entire matrix changes to orange in the sequence of the original clicks. This project demonstrates dynamic state management and event handling in React, providing an interactive and visually engaging example of React's capabilities.
